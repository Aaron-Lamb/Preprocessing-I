      <h3>Valuable skills</h3>
      <p>During high school, my focus was on writing, and so I am proficient in journalism style writing, and proper research techniques and referencing. I have excelled in writing semantic HTML, learning new technologies, and advanced CSS. I frequently volunteer in my area, and therefore I am more than willing to follow direction and help wherever I can, and work within any size of team.</p>
